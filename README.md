## Features

### 3DMark Score Calculator

Don't you hate not being able to know the 3DMark score of a PC you need to buy/upgrade before all the parts arrive? Use this tool!
It calculates the score it would have achieved in-game, so you can calculate it before buying, and modify your order to get the right score!

### Achievement List

Don't have achievements? Earn them anyways! Although you need to track them yourself, it still adds functionality otherwise gone.
*If you can already get achievements via the game launcher or anything else, this will do nothing for you. This is only for people who use... other... methods of achieving and playing the game.* ðŸ˜‰
